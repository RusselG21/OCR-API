# üîç OCR-API: Document Extraction System

## üß∞ Technology Stack

### üíª What Powers Our System

- **Python**: A user-friendly programming language that helps our system process information quickly and efficiently - think of it as the brain of our operation.

### üß© Main Building Blocks

- **üî§ Text Recognition Technology**: Our system can "read" text from images and documents, similar to how humans read but done by a computer.
- **üìë Specialized Document Processors**: We have different tools designed to handle specific types of documents:
  - üìù Resume Processor: Understands and extracts information from job applications
  - üë∂ Birth Certificate Processor: Pulls important details from birth records
  - ü™™ ID Document Processor: Works with driver's licenses, passports, and other identification
  - üéì Academic Certificate Processor: Handles diplomas and educational records
  - üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Work Permit Processor: Manages employment authorization documents

### üîÑ Connected Systems

- **‚òÅÔ∏è Google Drive Connection**: After we process your documents, we store them securely in Google Drive - similar to saving files in a digital filing cabinet.
- **üìä Airtable Connection**: We organize all the extracted information in Airtable - think of this as a smart spreadsheet that keeps everything organized.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Document Processing Works

Our document processing pipeline uses a series of technical components to manage, identify, and extract information. Here's how it works:

### üó∫Ô∏è Dictionary Mapping Structure

The system relies on four key dictionaries to manage the extraction flow:

1. **CONSTANT_COLUMN**: Maps confirmation keys to upload keys

   ```python
   CONSTANT_COLUMN = {
       "Extracted TIN Number Upload Confirmation": "TIN Number Upload",
       "Extracted Birth Certificate Confirmation": "Birth Certificate",
       "Extracted Occupational Permit Confirmation": "Occupational Permit",
       "Extracted SSS ID Upload Confirmation": "SSS ID Upload",
       "Extracted UMID Number Upload Confirmation": "UMID Number Upload",
       "Extracted Upload Resume Confirmation": "Upload Resume",
       "Extracted School Records Confirmation": "School Records"
   }
   ```

2. **CONSTANT_COLUMN_EXTRACTED**: Maps upload keys to extracted data fields

   ```python
   CONSTANT_COLUMN_EXTRACTED = {
       "TIN Number Upload": "Extracted TIN Number Upload",
       "Birth Certificate": "Extracted Birth Certificate",
       "Occupational Permit": "Extracted Occupational Permit",
       "SSS ID Upload": "Extracted SSS ID Upload",
       "UMID Number Upload": "Extracted UMID Number Upload",
       "Upload Resume": "Extracted Upload Resume",
       "School Records": "Extracted School Records"
   }
   ```

3. **DOCUMENT_REQUIREMENTS**: Associates extraction functions with document types

   ```python
   DOCUMENT_REQUIREMENTS = {
       "extract_birth_cert": ["Birth Certificate"],
       "extract_cv": ["Upload Resume"],
       "extract_id": ["SSS ID Upload", "UMID Number Upload", "TIN Number Upload"],
       "extract_diploma": ["School Records"],
       "extract_working_permit": ["Occupational Permit"]
   }
   ```

4. **EXTRACTOR_MAP**: Links extraction functions to their processor classes
   ```python
   EXTRACTOR_MAP = {
       "extract_birth_cert": BirthCertExtractor,
       "extract_cv": CVExtractor,
       "extract_id": IDExtractor,
       "extract_diploma": DiplomaExtractor,
       "extract_working_permit": WorkPerminExtractor
   }
   ```

### üîÑ Technical Process Flow

When a document enters our system, it undergoes this technical process:

1. **Document Ingestion**: The document is submitted via API endpoint or picked up by the automatic background service.

2. **Attachment Verification**: The system checks if the document has an attachment by examining if the corresponding key in `CONSTANT_COLUMN` contains "No Attachment".

3. **Processing Assessment**: If the document has an attachment and needs processing, the system proceeds to extraction.

4. **Extractor Function Mapping**: The system identifies the document type and maps it to the appropriate extraction function using the `DOCUMENT_REQUIREMENTS` dictionary.

5. **Processor Class Selection**: It retrieves the corresponding processor class via the `EXTRACTOR_MAP` dictionary (e.g., CVExtractor, IDExtractor).

6. **Information Extraction**: The processor class parses the document using OCR technology and structures the data according to predefined schemas.

7. **Cloud Storage**: The processed data is stored in Google Drive with appropriate metadata.

8. **Database Update**: The system updates Airtable using the `CONSTANT_COLUMN_EXTRACTED` dictionary to map fields correctly.

This technical pipeline ensures efficient document processing with appropriate routing based on document types. The system runs both on-demand via API endpoints and automatically through a scheduled background service.
